This project aims to integrate and analyze diverse data sources to gain insights into the correlations between weather patterns, birth rates, crime statistics, and energy consumption in Canada and the USA. By using big data technologies such as Spark and Hadoop, we aim to build a comprehensive ETL pipeline that facilitates the seamless collection, storage, and analysis of large datasets. The outcome will provide valuable insights to inform policy decisions and operational strategies across various sectors.
